# Start
* use better submit modal button colours

* failed jobs on results page
   - last element of the Step indicator to be swapped for failed

# Frontend
* results table
  - once when have more result data:
    - button for more info; slide-in element?
    - colour cells of entries that fail classification
    - button(s) to filter for failed, success, species?
      - clearable dropdown for failed/successed

* job page
  - inputs: spectra found in uploaded archive
  - outputs: stdout/stderr; link to results table page
  - history: timeline showing datetime for upload, init, queueing, execution, and completion

* job list
  - replace trash icon with circled 'x'

* always have scroll bar

* button to force refresh?
* use segments rather than grid for job list?
* axios to use multipart POST?
  - large files quickly filing /tmp/

# Backend
* add much more error handling

* memorable unique token rather than uuid?

* split classification into individual spectracl calls
  - if one bad fid in call, then all will fail

# Tool
* use rich: https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich
