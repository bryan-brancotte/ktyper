# Start
* submit modal 'another submission' button triggers full refresh, clears job data
  - change to reset state, or
  - implement persistent storage (this is preferred)

* use better submit modal button colours

* failed jobs on results page
   - Last element of the Step indicator to be swapped for failed

# Frontend
* results table
  - button for more info; slide-in element?
  - colour cells of entries that fail classification
  - button(s) to filter for failed, success, species?
    - clearable dropdown for failed/successed; multiselect for species
  - dropdown with search for species to select and multi selection
  - handle pagination

* job list
  - replace trash icon with circled 'x'

* localStorage to have persistent list of tokens
* always have scroll bar

* button to force refresh?
* use segments rather than grid for job list?
* axios to use multipart POST?
  - large files quickly filing /tmp/

# Backend
* add much more error handling

* memorable unique token rather than uuid?

* split classification into individual spectracl calls
  - if one bad fid in call, then all will fail
